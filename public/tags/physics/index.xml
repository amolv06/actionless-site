      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The method of images is almost a real life mathematical cheat code. Imagine being able to solve what happens due to some intricate arrangement of charges on a conducting surface, but pretending as though it&amp;rsquo;s a single point charge. When I first saw this, I was quite stunned. It seems absurd that to solve one problem you solve, more or less, a completely separate problem. However the clever application of a mathematical principle ensures that the solutions to the two problems are the same. Instead of solving a hard physics problem it allows you to solve a much easier, barely related problem, and then insist that the solution to the two is the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
